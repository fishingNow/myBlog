    summary: |
      In the Shenzhen Cloud Application Development Competition, I participated in developing a Grade Analysis and Management System. The system utilized a cloud-based architecture, integrating features such as grade entry, dynamic analysis, and visualized reporting, with support for real-time access across devices. Through innovative design and an enhanced user experience, our project earned recognition from the judges during the presentation and ultimately won the second prize. This experience greatly improved my teamwork and cloud application development skills.
